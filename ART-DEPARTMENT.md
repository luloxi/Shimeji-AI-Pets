## Mission

Create expressive, lovable shimejis that arrive through intergalactic portals and carry the user's intention.

## Core Pillars

1. **Intentionality** — Each shimeji reflects the user's intention (focus, calm, joy).
2. **Charm** — Simple, readable silhouettes with big personality.
3. **Motion** — Subtle idle motion and clear walk cycles.

## Portal Workflow

1. Review the portal intention.
2. Draft a style direction for the companion.
3. Produce a sprite sheet (idle, walk, climb, fall, grab).
4. Export at consistent scale and palette.
5. Deliver sprites for ingestion into the extension.

## Art Specs
