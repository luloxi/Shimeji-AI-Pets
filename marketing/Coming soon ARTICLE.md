# Your Portal Is Open: A Preview of Shimeji Factory!

What if your next digital companion didn’t come from a marketplace, but through an intergalactic portal you open yourself? Shimeji Factory is building that experience.

We’re creating a ritual where you connect your Stellar wallet, open a portal, set an intention, and receive a handcrafted shimeji that lives on your desktop. Your companion follows your cursor, wanders when idle, and adds a little magic to every browsing session.

## Why it matters

- **Personal meaning:** Your intention guides the companion’s style and behavior.
- **Daily utility:** Shimejis live with you, not just in a gallery.
- **Handcrafted art:** Each sprite is animated by artists with care.

## How it works

1. Open a portal on the Factory site
2. Set an intention for your companion
3. Wait for the artist to craft your shimeji
4. Install the extension and watch it come to life

We’re in preview now, building the first wave of portals. If you want a companion that feels truly yours, Shimeji Factory is about to open.
